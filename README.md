TOP Recipe Project
In this lesson, I am going to create an HTML website with 3 different recipes. Each recipe with list all the ingredients needed (unordered) and the steps necessary for the recipe (ordered). Additionally, there will be photos of each recipe, various uses of texts (bold/italicized/headers/etc) and more. Should be a fun learning process.
